# EchoSign-Intrepreter
EchoSign Interpreter is a Python-based speech-to-sign language translator that helps bridge communication between hearing and hearing-impaired individuals. It captures spoken sentences, recognizes words, and displays matching hand gestures using a deep learning model and a PyQt UI.

# EchoSign Interpreter  
*A Real-Time Speech-to-Sign Language Translator*

## Overview  
**EchoSign Interpreter** is a Python-based speech-to-sign language translator that aims to assist communication between hearing individuals and the hearing-impaired community. The application captures spoken sentences, breaks them down into individual words, and displays corresponding hand gestures using a deep learning model trained on custom gesture data. A smooth and interactive PyQt-based UI enhances the user experience.

##  Features  
-  Real-time **speech recognition** using SpeechRecognition and PyAudio  
-  **Word-by-word gesture mapping** via a custom-trained CNN using TensorFlow  
-  Organized **gesture dataset** with individual folders for each word  
-  **PyQt5 interface** with smooth transitions and row-based gesture display  
-  Built from scratch â€” from dataset collection to model training and UI integration

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- PyQt5  
- SpeechRecognition  
- PyAudio
